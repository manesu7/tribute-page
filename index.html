      <h2>Aznavour's Honors </h2>
      <ul>
        <p> Aznavour was born on 1924, May 22 in Paris in an armenian family of artists. He was named Shahnour (or Chahnour) Vaghinag Aznavourian (Armenian: Շահնուր Վաղինակ Ազնավուրեան), 
					by his parents, Armenian immigrants Michael Aznavourian and Knar Baghdasarian. His father sang in restaurants in France before establishing a Caucasian restaurant
					called Le Caucase. Charles's parents introduced him to performing at an early age, 
					and he dropped out of school at age nine, and took the stage name "Aznavour."</p>
